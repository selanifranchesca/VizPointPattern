\title{Clean Contamination Sample Data
This function loads, cleans, and processes the Flint water sample data.
It renames columns, removes irrelevant ones, handles missing values,
and unites address components for geocoding.}
\usage{
clean_contamination_data(
  file_path,
  sheet = 1,
  contamination_col_mapping,
  address_cols,
  other_cols_to_drop = NULL,
  unite_address_col_name = "Address",
  remove_address_components = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A character string specifying the path to the Excel data file.}

\item{sheet}{The sheet number or name to read from the Excel file (default: 1).}

\item{contamination_col_mapping}{A named character vector or list.
Names should be the desired new column names (e.g., "Lead", "Copper_250ml"),
and values should be the existing column names in the raw data
(e.g., "Analysis..Lead.", "X250.ml.Bottle..PPB.").}

\item{address_cols}{A character vector of column names containing address components
to be united (e.g., c("Street", "Street.Name", "City", "Zip.Code")).}

\item{other_cols_to_drop}{A character vector of any other column names
to drop from the dataset (e.g., "Analysis..Copper."). If NULL, no
additional columns are dropped.}

\item{unite_address_col_name}{The desired name for the united address column (default: "Address").}

\item{remove_address_components}{Logical. If TRUE, the original address_cols will be removed
after uniting them into a single address column (default: FALSE).}

\value{
A tibble (data frame) with cleaned and processed contamination sample data.
